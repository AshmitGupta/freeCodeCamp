# --description--

In the previous step, you found the position of the `@` character in an email address.

As you learned in Part 1 of this workshop, you can use **string slicing** to extract specific parts of a string.

As a reminder, the slicing syntax looks like this:

```py
string[start:end]
```

- `start` is the index where slicing begins (included)
- `end` is the index where slicing stops (not included)

In this step, use slicing to extract the username from the `email` string.
The username is the part of the email that comes before the `@` symbol.

Use `at_position` to slice the string and assign the result to a variable called `username`

# --hints--

You should use string slicing on the email string.

```js
```

You should slice the string from the beginning up to `at_position`.

```js
```

You should assign the sliced value to a variable called username.

```js
```

You should not hardcode the value of `username`. Use `at_position` to determine where to slice the string.

```js
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
email = 'alice.johnson@company.com'
at_position = email.find('@')

--fcc-editable-region--
username = None
--fcc-editable-region--

print('Email: ' + email)
print('Username: ' + str(username))
```
