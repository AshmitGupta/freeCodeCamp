# --description--

In previous lessons, you learned that strings are sequences of characters.

Python provides the `find()` method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of a character or substring inside a string.

```py
text = "freeCodeCamp"
print(text.find("C"))  # 4
print(text.find("Camp"))  # 8
```

You are given an `email` string.

Use the `find()` method to locate the position of the `@` character and assign the result to a variable called `at_position`.

# --hints--

You should not leave `at_position` set to `None`.

```js
```

You should use the `find()` method on the `email` string.

```js
```

You should search for the `@` character using `email.find("@")`.

```js
```

You should assign the result of `email.find("@")` to the `at_position` variable.

```js
```

You should not hardcode the value of `at_position`. You should compute it using `find()`.

```js
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
email = "alice.johnson@company.com"

--fcc-editable-region--
at_position = None
--fcc-editable-region--

print("Email: " + email)
print("Position of @: " + str(at_position))
```
