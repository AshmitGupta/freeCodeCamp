## Introduction to the Build an Employee Profile Generator: Part 2

In Part 1, you learned how to work with basic strings to build an employee profile generator.

In this workshop, you will use Python’s built-in string methods to work with employee data such as emails, names and codes.

You will learn how to:

- Find information inside strings using `find()` and `in`.
- Clean and format strings using `strip()`, `lower()`, `upper()` and `title()`.
- Modify strings using `replace()`, `split()` and `join()`.
- Validate string values using `startswith()`, `endswith()` and `count()`.
